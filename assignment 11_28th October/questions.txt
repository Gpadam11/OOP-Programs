ASSIGNMENT 11

1.Create a class shape. Derive three classes from it; Circle, Square and Triangle. Find area of each shape and display it, using virtual function. 

2.Create a class which stores employee name, id and salary Derive two classes from ‘Employee’ class: ‘Regular’ and ‘Part-Time’. The ‘Regular’ class stores DA, HRA and basic salary. The ‘Part-Time’ class stores the number of hours and pay per hour. Calculate the salary of a regular employee and a par-time employee, using virtual function.

3.Create a class which stores account number, customer name and balance. Derive two classes from ‘Account’ class: ‘Savings’ and ‘Current’. The ‘Savings’ class stores minimum balance. The ‘Current’ class stores the over-due amount. Include member functions in the appropriate class for 
                            -deposit money 
                            -withdraw [For saving account minimum balance should be checked.] [For current    account overdue amount should be calculated.] 
                           -display balance 
Display data from each class using virtual function. 

4.WAP to demonstrate use of pure virtual function and abstract base class. 

5.WAP to add two objects of distance class. Overload the operator ‘>’ to compare two objects and return the object with larger time value and display it. Overload the ‘==’ operator to compare and display whether two given objects contain same distance value. 

6.WAP to add two objects of time class. Overload the operator ‘==’ to compare two objects and display whether they are equal or not. 

7.WAP to create a class Time. Convert time (hh:mm:ss) into seconds (integer value). [Class to Basic]

8.WAP to create a class distance having data members km, meter, cm. User enters the distance in centimeters. Convert the distance into km:meter:cm. [Basic to Class]
